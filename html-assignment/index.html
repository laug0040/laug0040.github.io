            <h2>About Me</h2>
        </article>
        <p>I graduated highschool last year in June 22<sup>nd</sup> 2023 and joined Algonquin for the first time during the 2023 fall semester in <em>Computer Engineering</em>.  I thought to myself the program wasn't for me, so I decided to go to <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> for the 2024 Winter semester due to the content of the program being more interesting to me than <em>Computer Engineering.</em></p>
        <p>The reason I say this program is more interesting to me is due to me doing a lot of the stuff we're learning in highschool, so I already have a decent amount of knowledge to kickstart my learning experience for this semester.  I also do some of these things during my free time and I really enjoy it.</p>
