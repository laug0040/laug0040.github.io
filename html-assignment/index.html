        </article>
        <p>I graduated highschool last year in 2023 and joined Algonquin for the first time during the 2023 fall semester in Computer Engineering.  I thought to myself the program wasn't for me, so I decided to go to Interactive Media Design for the 2024 Winter semester due to the content of the program being more interesting to me than Computer Engineering.</p>
